## Introduction
      Text classification is the process of assigning predefined categories to free-text documents. This repository provides a Python implementation for text classification tasks, including cleaning text data, preparing models, comparing different classification algorithms, and web crawling.

## Steps Involved in Cleaning
      Converting all the letters to lowercase: Convert all letters in the text to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
      Remove punctuation, newlines: Eliminate punctuation marks and newlines from the text data.
      Tokenize: Split the text into individual words or tokens.
      Remove stopwords: Remove common words that carry little to no meaning in the context of text analysis, such as 'and', 'the', 'is', etc.
## Model Preparation
    train_test_split: Prepare the dataset by splitting it into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
## Various Models
    1.Desicion Tree Classifier: A decision tree is a flowchart-like tree structure where an internal node represents a feature, the branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome.
    2.Random Forest Classifier: Random forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes of the individual trees.
    3.Ada Booster Classifier: AdaBoost, short for Adaptive Boosting, is a boosting technique that aims to correct the errors of the weak classifiers iteratively.
    4.LSTM: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture designed to overcome the vanishing gradient problem.
## Comparison Between Different Models
    This section compares the performance of various classification models implemented in this repository.

## Web Crawling
    Web crawling is the process of automatically collecting information from the web. This repository includes tools for web crawling to gather data for text classification tasks.
